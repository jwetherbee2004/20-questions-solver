# 20-questions-solver
This project develops an AI-based 20 Questions solver in Java that identifies unknown nouns (e.g., animals) through entropy-driven yes/no questions. Using information gain, it narrows possibilities dynamically, incorporates probabilistic reasoning, and learns new objects via feedback, demonstrating applied AI reasoning

To run the program, navigate to App.java and execute the file. If it fails to run, run it again. On first load, it tends to have a FileNotFoundException, although running it a second time will run the program just fine. From there, answer the questions in the terminal using y for yes, n for no, and m for maybe!
